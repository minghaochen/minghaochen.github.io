      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;bats&#34;&gt;Bats&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all sounds made by animals &lt;strong&gt;serve as&lt;/strong&gt; language, and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly &lt;strong&gt;utilitarian&lt;/strong&gt; role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a full appreciation of what this means we must turn first to some recent human inventions. Everyone knows that if he shouts in the &lt;strong&gt;vicinity&lt;/strong&gt; of a wall or a mountainside, an echo will come back. The further off this solid &lt;strong&gt;obstruction&lt;/strong&gt; the longer time will &lt;strong&gt;elapse&lt;/strong&gt; for the return of the echo. A sound made by tapping on the &lt;strong&gt;hull&lt;/strong&gt; of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated. So was born the echo-sounding &lt;strong&gt;apparatus&lt;/strong&gt;, now in general use in ships. Every solid object will reflect a sound, varying according to the size and nature of the object. A &lt;strong&gt;shoal&lt;/strong&gt; of fish will do this. So it is a &lt;strong&gt;comparatively&lt;/strong&gt; simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish. With experience, and with improved apparatus, it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but to tell if it is &lt;strong&gt;herring&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;cod&lt;/strong&gt;, or other well-known fish, by the pattern of its echo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago it was found that certain bats &lt;strong&gt;emit&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;squeaks&lt;/strong&gt; and by receiving the echoes they could locate and &lt;strong&gt;steer&lt;/strong&gt; clear of obstacles&amp;ndash;or locate flying insects on which they feed. This echo-location in bats is often compared with radar, the principle of which is similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;词汇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;utilitarian  / juːˌtɪlɪˈtɛərɪən / objects and buildings are designed to be useful rather than attractive. (物体、建筑等) 实用的&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vicinity / vɪˈsɪnɪtɪ / If something is in the vicinity of a particular place, it is near it. (在…) 附近&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;elapse / ɪˈlæps /  When time elapses, it passes. (时间) 流逝&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tap / tæp / If you tap something, you hit it with a quick light blow or a series of quick light blows. 轻敲&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apparatus / ˌæpəˈreɪtəs / the equipment, such as tools and machines, which is used to do a particular job or activity. 设备&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shoal / ʃəʊl / A shoal of fish is a large group of them swimming together. 鱼群&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;herring  / ˈhɛrɪŋ /  A herring is a long silver-coloured fish. Herring live in large groups in the ocean. 鲱 (鱼)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cod / kɒd / Cod are a type of large edible fish. 鳕鱼&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;trading-standards&#34;&gt;Trading standards&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chickens &lt;strong&gt;slaughtered&lt;/strong&gt; in the United States, claim officials in Brussels, are not fit to &lt;strong&gt;grace&lt;/strong&gt; European tables. No, say the Americans: our &lt;strong&gt;fowl&lt;/strong&gt; are fine, we simply clean them in a different way. These days, it is differences in national regulations, far more than tariffs, that put sand in the wheels of trade between rich countries. It is not just farmers who are complaining . An electric &lt;strong&gt;razor&lt;/strong&gt; that meets the European Union’s safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States, and an American-made &lt;strong&gt;dialysis&lt;/strong&gt; machine needs the EU’s okay before it &lt;strong&gt;hits&lt;/strong&gt; the market in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, a razor that is safe in Europe is unlikely to &lt;strong&gt;electrocute&lt;/strong&gt; Americans. So, ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, why have two lots of tests where one would do? Politicians agree, in principle, so America and the EU have been trying to reach a deal which would eliminate the need to double-test many products. They hope to finish in time for a trade summit between America and EU on May 28th. Although negotiators are optimistic, the details are complex enough that they may be &lt;strong&gt;hard-pressed&lt;/strong&gt; to get a deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? One difficulty is to construct the agreements. The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devices and then &lt;strong&gt;hammer&lt;/strong&gt; out different pacts covering, say, electronic goods and drug manufacturing. The EU-following fine &lt;strong&gt;continental&lt;/strong&gt; traditions—wants agreement on general principles, which could be applied to many types of products and have extended to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;词汇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slaughter / ˈslɔːtə / If large numbers of people or animals are slaughtered, they are killed in a way that is cruel or unnecessary. 屠杀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grace / ɡreɪs / If you say that something graces a place or a person, you mean that it makes them more attractive. 使优美&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fowl  / faʊl / A fowl is a bird, especially one that can be eaten as food, such as a duck or a chicken. 家禽&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;razor / ˈreɪzə / A razor is a tool that people use for shaving. 剃刀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dialysis / daɪˈælɪsɪs /   Dialysis or kidney dialysis is a method of treating kidney failure by using a machine to remove waste material from the kidneys. (肾的)透析&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;electrocute  / ɪˈlɛktrəˌkjuːt /  If someone is electrocuted, they are accidentally killed or badly injured when they touch something connected to a source of electricity. 使…触电 (死亡或受伤)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hammer If people hammer out an agreement or treaty, they succeed in producing it after a long or difficult discussion. (经过长时间或艰难的讨论) 制定出&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continental  / ˌkɒntɪˈnɛntəl / Continental is used to refer to something that belongs to or relates to a continent. 大陆的&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;royal-espionage&#34;&gt;Royal &lt;strong&gt;espionage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred the Great acted as his own spy, visiting Danish camps disguised as a &lt;strong&gt;minstrel&lt;/strong&gt;. In those days wandering minstrels were welcome everywhere. They were not fighting men, and their &lt;strong&gt;harp&lt;/strong&gt; was their passport. Alfred had learned many of their &lt;strong&gt;ballads&lt;/strong&gt; in his youth, and could vary his programme with &lt;strong&gt;acrobatic&lt;/strong&gt; tricks and simple &lt;strong&gt;conjuring&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Alfred&amp;rsquo;s little army slowly began to gather at Athelney, the king himself set out to &lt;strong&gt;penetrate&lt;/strong&gt; the camp of Guthrum, the commander of the Danish invaders. These had &lt;strong&gt;settled down&lt;/strong&gt; for the winter at Chippenham: &lt;strong&gt;thither&lt;/strong&gt; Alfred went. He noticed at once that discipline was slack: the Danes had the self-confidence of &lt;strong&gt;conquerors&lt;/strong&gt;, and their security precautions were casual. They lived well, on the &lt;strong&gt;proceeds&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;raids&lt;/strong&gt; on neighbouring regions. There they collected women as well as food and drink, and &lt;strong&gt;a life of ease&lt;/strong&gt; had made them soft. Alfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athelney. The force there assembled was trivial compared with the Danish &lt;strong&gt;horde&lt;/strong&gt;. But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer fit for prolonged battle : and that their &lt;strong&gt;commissariat&lt;/strong&gt; had no organization, but depended on irregular raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, faced with the Danish &lt;strong&gt;advance&lt;/strong&gt;, Alfred did not risk open battle but &lt;strong&gt;harried&lt;/strong&gt; the enemy. He was constantly on the move, drawing the Danes after him. His &lt;strong&gt;patrols&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;halted&lt;/strong&gt; the raiding parties: hunger &lt;strong&gt;assailed&lt;/strong&gt; the Danish army. Now Alfred began a long series of &lt;strong&gt;skirmishes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ndash;and within a month the Danes had surrendered. The episode could reasonably serve as a unique &lt;strong&gt;epic&lt;/strong&gt; of royal espionage!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;lesson-4-seeing-hands&#34;&gt;Lesson 4 Seeing hands&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Soviet Union several cases have been reported recently of people who can read and detect colours with their fingers, and even &lt;strong&gt;see through&lt;/strong&gt; solid doors and walls. One case &lt;strong&gt;concerns&lt;/strong&gt; an &amp;lsquo;eleven-year-old schoolgirl, Vera Petrova, who has normal vision but who can also &lt;strong&gt;perceive&lt;/strong&gt; things with different parts of her skin, and through solid walls. This ability was first noticed by her father. One day she came into his office and &lt;strong&gt;happened&lt;/strong&gt; to put her hands on the door of a locked safe. Suddenly she asked her father why he kept so many old newspapers locked away there, and even described the way they were &lt;strong&gt;done up&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;bundles&lt;/strong&gt;. Vera&amp;rsquo;s curious talent was brought to the notice of a scientific research institute in the town of UIyanovsk, near where she lives, and in April she was given a series of tests by a special &lt;strong&gt;commission&lt;/strong&gt; of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federal Republic. During these tests she was able to read a newspaper through an opaque screen and, stranger still, by moving her elbow over a child&amp;rsquo;s game of Lotto she was able to describe the figures and colours printed on it; and, in another instance, wearing stockings and slippers, to &lt;strong&gt;make out&lt;/strong&gt; with her foot the outlines and colours of a picture hidden under a &lt;strong&gt;carpet&lt;/strong&gt;. Other experiments showed that her knees and shoulders had a similar sensitivity. During all these tests Vera was &lt;strong&gt;blindfold&lt;/strong&gt;; and, indeed, except when blindfold she lacked the ability to perceive things with her skin. lt was also found that although she could perceive things with her fingers this ability ceased the moment her hands were wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;词汇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concern: /kənˈsɚn/ to relate to (something or someone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perceive /pɚˈsiːv/ to notice or become aware of (something)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;happen: /ˈhæpən/ to do or be something by chance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do up:  to wrap (something).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bundle: /ˈbʌndəl/ a group of things that are fastened, tied, or wrapped together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commission: /kəˈmɪʃən/ a group of people who have been given the official job of finding information about something or controlling something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make out: to see and identify (something)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;carpet: /ˈkɑɚpət/ a thick covering : a thick layer of something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blindfold: /ˈblaɪndˌfoʊld/ cover the eyes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lesson-5-youth&#34;&gt;Lesson 5 Youth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are always talking about &amp;lsquo;the problem of youth&amp;rsquo;. If there is one&amp;ndash;which I take leave to doubt&amp;ndash;then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves. Let us &lt;strong&gt;get down to&lt;/strong&gt; fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings&amp;ndash;people just like their elders. There is only one difference between an old man and a young one: the young man has a glorious future before him and the old one has a splendid future behind him: and maybe that is where the &lt;strong&gt;rub&lt;/strong&gt; is.
When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and uncertain&amp;ndash;that I was a new boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking.
I find young people exciting. They have an air of freedom, and they have not a &lt;strong&gt;dreary&lt;/strong&gt; commitment to mean ambitions or love of comfort. They are not anxious social climbers, and they have &lt;strong&gt;no devotion to&lt;/strong&gt; material things. All this seems to me to link them with life, and the origins of things. It&amp;rsquo;s as if they were in some sense cosmic beings in &lt;strong&gt;violent&lt;/strong&gt; and lovely contrast with us &lt;strong&gt;suburban&lt;/strong&gt; creatures. All that is in my mind when I meet a young person. He may be &lt;strong&gt;conceited&lt;/strong&gt;, ill-mannered, &lt;strong&gt;presumptuous&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;fatuous&lt;/strong&gt;, but I do not turn for protection to &lt;strong&gt;dreary&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;clichés&lt;/strong&gt; about respect for elders&amp;ndash;as if mere age were a reason for respect. I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;词汇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get down to: to start doing something that is difficult or needs a lot of time or energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rub: /ˈrʌb/ something that causes a difficulty or problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dreary: /ˈdriri/ dull and making you feel sad or bored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;violent: /ˈvajələnt/ very forceful or intense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suburban: /səˈbɚbən/ boring and typical of people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conceited: /kənˈsiːtəd/ having or showing too much pride in your own worth or goodness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presumptuous: /prɪˈzʌmptʃuəs/ doing something that you have no right to do and that seems rude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fatuous: /ˈfætʃuəs/ very silly or stupid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clichés: an idea or phrase that has been used so much that it is not effective or does not have any meaning any longer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lesson-6-the-sporting-spirit&#34;&gt;Lesson 6 The sporting spirit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates &lt;strong&gt;goodwill&lt;/strong&gt; between the nations, and that if only the common peoples of the world could meet one another at football or cricket, they would have no &lt;strong&gt;inclination&lt;/strong&gt; to meet on the battlefield. Even if one didn&amp;rsquo;t know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to &lt;strong&gt;orgies&lt;/strong&gt; of hatred, one could &lt;strong&gt;deduce&lt;/strong&gt; it from general principles. Nearly all the sports practised nowadays are competitive. You play to win, and the game has little meaning unless you do your utmost to win. On the village green, where you &lt;strong&gt;pick up sides&lt;/strong&gt; and no feeling of local &lt;strong&gt;patriotism&lt;/strong&gt; is involved, it is possible to play simply for the fun and exercise: but as soon as the question of &lt;strong&gt;prestige&lt;/strong&gt; arises, as soon as you feel that you and some larger unit will be &lt;strong&gt;disgraced&lt;/strong&gt; if you lose, the most &lt;strong&gt;savage&lt;/strong&gt; combative instincts are &lt;strong&gt;aroused&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone who has played even in a school football match knows this. At the international level sport is frankly mimic &lt;strong&gt;warfare&lt;/strong&gt;. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the &lt;strong&gt;spectators&lt;/strong&gt;: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into &lt;strong&gt;furies&lt;/strong&gt; over these &lt;strong&gt;absurd&lt;/strong&gt; contests, and seriously believe&amp;ndash;&lt;strong&gt;at any rate&lt;/strong&gt; for short periods&amp;ndash;that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national &lt;strong&gt;virtue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;词汇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;goodwill: /ˌgʊdˈwɪl/ a kind, helpful, or friendly feeling or attitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inclination: /ˌɪnkləˈneɪʃən/  a feeling of wanting to do something : a tendency to do something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;orgy: /ˈoɚʤi/ something that is done too much and in a wild way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deduce: /dɪˈduːs/ to use logic or reason to form (a conclusion or opinion about something)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;side: a sports team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prestige: /prɛˈstiːʒ/ the respect and admiration that someone or something gets for being successful or important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disgrace: /dɪˈskreɪs/ to cause (someone) to feel ashamed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;savage: /ˈsævɪʤ/ very cruel or violent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arouse: /əˈraʊz/ to cause (an emotional or mental state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;warfare: /ˈwoɚˌfeɚ/ military fighting in a war&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spectator: someone who is watching an event or game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fury: /ˈfjuri/ violent anger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;absurd: /əbˈsɚd/ extremely silly, foolish, or unreasonable : completely ridiculous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at any rate: anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;virtue: /ˈvɚtʃu/ morally good behavior or character&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;finding-fossil-man&#34;&gt;Finding Fossil man&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can &lt;strong&gt;read of&lt;/strong&gt; things that happened 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where people first learned to write. But there are some parts of the world where even now people cannot write. The only way that they can preserve their history is to &lt;strong&gt;recount&lt;/strong&gt; it as sagas&amp;ndash;legends &lt;strong&gt;handed down&lt;/strong&gt; from one generation of story-tellers to another. These legends are useful because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but none could write down what they did. &lt;strong&gt;Anthropologists&lt;/strong&gt; wondered where the remote ancestors of the Polynesian (波利尼西亚人) peoples now living in the Pacific Islands (太平洋群岛) came from. The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia (印度尼西亚) about 2,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas, if they had any, are forgotten. So &lt;strong&gt;archaeologists&lt;/strong&gt; have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the first &amp;lsquo;modern men&amp;rsquo; came from. Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially &lt;strong&gt;flint&lt;/strong&gt;, because this is easier to shape than other kinds. They may also have used wood and skins, but these have &lt;strong&gt;rotted away&lt;/strong&gt;. Stone does not decay, and so the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;词汇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, you may wonder, should spiders be our friends ? Because they destroy so many insects, and insects include some of the greatest enemies of the human race. Insects would make it impossible for us to live in the world; they would &lt;strong&gt;devour&lt;/strong&gt; all our crops and kill our flocks and herds, if it were not for the protection we get from insect-eating animals. We owe a lot to the birds and beasts who eat insects but all of them put together kill only &lt;strong&gt;a fraction of&lt;/strong&gt; the number destroyed by spiders. Moreover, unlike some of the other insect eaters, spiders never do the least harm to us or our belongings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiders are not insects, as many people think, nor even nearly related to them. One can tell the difference almost at a glance for a spider always has eight legs and an insect never more than six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many spiders &lt;strong&gt;are engaged in&lt;/strong&gt; this work on our behalf ? One authority on spiders made a census of the spiders in a grass field in the south of England, and he estimated that there were more than 2,250,000 in one &lt;strong&gt;acre&lt;/strong&gt;, that is something like 6,000,000 spiders of different kinds on a football &lt;strong&gt;pitch&lt;/strong&gt;. Spiders are busy for at least half the year in killing insects. It is impossible to make more than the wildest guess at how many they kill, but they are hungry creatures, not content with only three meals a day. It has been estimated that the weight of all the insects destroyed by spiders in Britain in one year would be greater than the total weight of all the human beings in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;词汇&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spare: /ˈspeɚ/ to not destroy or harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;devour: /dɪˈvawɚ/  to destroy (something) completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a fraction of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be engaged in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pitch: /ˈpɪtʃ/ an area that is used for playing sports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;句型&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has been estimated that&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;matterhorn-马特洪峰-man&#34;&gt;Matterhorn (马特洪峰) man&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern &lt;strong&gt;alpinists&lt;/strong&gt; try to climb mountains by a route which will give them good sport, and the more difficult it is, the more highly it is regarded. In the pioneering days, however, this was not the case at all. The early climbers were looking for the easiest way to the top because the summit was the prize they sought, especially if it had never been attained before. It is true that during their explorations they often faced difficulties and dangers of the most perilous nature, equipped in a manner which would make a modern climber &lt;strong&gt;shudder&lt;/strong&gt; at the thought, but they did not go out of their way to court such excitement. They had a single aim, a solitary goal&amp;ndash;the top!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard for us to realize nowadays how difficult it was for the pioneers. &lt;strong&gt;Except for&lt;/strong&gt; one or two places such as Zermatt (策马特) and Chamonix (夏蒙尼), which had rapidly become popular, Alpine (阿尔卑斯山的) villages tended to be &lt;strong&gt;impoverished settlements&lt;/strong&gt; cut off from civilization by the high mountains. Such &lt;strong&gt;inns&lt;/strong&gt; as there were were generally dirty and &lt;strong&gt;flea-ridden&lt;/strong&gt;; the food simply local cheese accompanied by bread often twelve months old, all washed down with coarse wine. Often a valley boasted no inn at all, and climbers found shelter wherever they could&amp;ndash;sometimes with the local priest (who was usually as poor as his parishioners), sometimes with shepherds or cheesemakers. Invariably the background was the same: dirt and poverty, and very uncomfortable. For men accustomed to eating seven-course dinners and sleeping between fine &lt;strong&gt;linen&lt;/strong&gt; sheets at home, the change to the Alps must have been very hard indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
