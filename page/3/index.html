      <h1 id="silicon-valley">Silicon valley</h1>

<p>Technology trends may push Silicon Valley <strong>back</strong> to the future. Carver Mead, a pioneer in integrated circuits and a professor of computer science at the California Institute of Technology, notes there are now workstations that enable engineers to design, test and produce chips right on their desks, <strong>much the way</strong> an editor creates a newsletter on a Macintosh. As the time and cost of making a chip <strong>drop</strong> to a few days and a few hundred dollars, engineers may soon be free to let their imaginations soar without being penalized by expensive failures. Mead predicts that inventors will be able to perfect powerful customized chips over a weekend at the office—spawning a new generation of garage start-ups and <strong>giving</strong> the U.S. <strong>a jump on its</strong> foreign rivals in <strong>getting</strong> new products <strong>to</strong> market fast. ‘We’ve got more garages with smart people,’ Mead observes. ‘We really <strong>thrive</strong> on <strong>anarchy</strong>.’</p>

<p>And on Asians. Already, orientals and Asian Americans <strong>constitute</strong> the majority of the engineering staffs at many Valley firms. And Chinese, Korean, Filipino and Indian engineers are graduating in <strong>droves</strong> from California’s colleges. As <strong>the heads of</strong> next-generation start-ups, these Asian innovators can <strong>draw on</strong> customs and languages to <strong>forge</strong> tighter links with crucial Pacific <strong>Rim</strong> market. For instance, Alex Au, a Stanford Ph.D. from Hong Kong, has set up a Taiwan factory to challenge Japan’s near <strong>lock on</strong> the memory-chip market. India-born N. Damodar Reddy’s tiny California company reopened an AT&amp;T chip plant in Kansas City last spring with financing from the state of Missouri. Before it becomes a retirement village, Silicon Valley may <strong>prove</strong> a classroom for building a global business.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-grow-old">How to grow old</h1>

<p>Some old people are <strong>oppressed</strong> by the fear of death. In the young there is a justification for this feeling. Young men who have reason to fear that they will be killed in battle may <strong>justifiably</strong> feel bitter in the thought that they have been cheated of the best things that life has to offer. But in an old man who has known human joys and sorrows, and has achieved whatever work it was in him to do, the fear of death is somewhat <strong>abject</strong> and ignoble. The best way to overcome it-so at least it seems to me&mdash;-is to make your interests gradually wider and more <strong>impersonal</strong>, until bit by bit the walls of the <strong>ego</strong> recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life. An individual human <strong>existence</strong> should be like a river&ndash;small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past <strong>boulders</strong> and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being. The man who, in old age, can see his life in this way, will not suffer from the fear of death, since the things he cares for will continue. And it, with the decay of <strong>vitality</strong>, <strong>weariness</strong> increases, the thought of rest will be not unwelcome. I should wish to die while still at work, knowing that others will carry on what I can no longer do, and content in the thought that what was possible has been done.</p>

<h1 id="banks-and-their-customers">Banks and their customers</h1>

<p>When anyone opens a current account at a bank, he is lending the bank money, repayment of which he may demand at any time, either in cash or by <strong>drawing a cheque</strong> in favour of another person. Primarily, the banker-customer relationship is that of debtor and creditor&ndash;who is which depending on whether the customer&rsquo;s account is <strong>in credit</strong> or is overdrawn. But, in addition to that basically simple concept, the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another. Many of these obligations can give rise to problems and complications but a bank customer, unlike, say, a buyer of goods, cannot complain that the law is <strong>loaded against</strong> him.</p>

<p>The bank must obey its customer&rsquo;s instructions, and not those of anyone else. When, for example, a customer first opens an account, he instructs the bank to debit his account only in respect of cheques drawn by himself. He gives the bank <strong>specimens</strong> of his signature, and there is a very firm rule that the bank has no right or authority to pay out a customer&rsquo;s money on a cheque on which its customer&rsquo;s signature has been forged. It makes no difference that the <strong>forgery</strong> may have been a very skilful one: the bank must recognize its customer&rsquo;s signature.</p>

<p>For this reason there is no risk to the customer in the modern practice, adopted by some banks, of printing the customer&rsquo;s name on his cheques. If this facilitates forgery it is the bank which will lose, not the customer.</p>
