      <h1 id="bats">Bats</h1>

<p>Not all sounds made by animals <strong>serve as</strong> language, and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly <strong>utilitarian</strong> role.</p>

<p>To get a full appreciation of what this means we must turn first to some recent human inventions. Everyone knows that if he shouts in the <strong>vicinity</strong> of a wall or a mountainside, an echo will come back. The further off this solid <strong>obstruction</strong> the longer time will <strong>elapse</strong> for the return of the echo. A sound made by tapping on the <strong>hull</strong> of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated. So was born the echo-sounding <strong>apparatus</strong>, now in general use in ships. Every solid object will reflect a sound, varying according to the size and nature of the object. A <strong>shoal</strong> of fish will do this. So it is a <strong>comparatively</strong> simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish. With experience, and with improved apparatus, it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but to tell if it is <strong>herring</strong>, <strong>cod</strong>, or other well-known fish, by the pattern of its echo.</p>

<p>A few years ago it was found that certain bats <strong>emit</strong> <strong>squeaks</strong> and by receiving the echoes they could locate and <strong>steer</strong> clear of obstacles&ndash;or locate flying insects on which they feed. This echo-location in bats is often compared with radar, the principle of which is similar.</p>

<h1 id="trading-standards">Trading standards</h1>

<p>Chickens <strong>slaughtered</strong> in the United States, claim officials in Brussels, are not fit to <strong>grace</strong> European tables. No, say the Americans: our <strong>fowl</strong> are fine, we simply clean them in a different way. These days, it is differences in national regulations, far more than tariffs, that put sand in the wheels of trade between rich countries. It is not just farmers who are complaining . An electric <strong>razor</strong> that meets the European Union’s safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States, and an American-made <strong>dialysis</strong> machine needs the EU’s okay before it <strong>hits</strong> the market in Europe.</p>

<p>As it happens, a razor that is safe in Europe is unlikely to <strong>electrocute</strong> Americans. So, ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, why have two lots of tests where one would do? Politicians agree, in principle, so America and the EU have been trying to reach a deal which would eliminate the need to double-test many products. They hope to finish in time for a trade summit between America and EU on May 28th. Although negotiators are optimistic, the details are complex enough that they may be <strong>hard-pressed</strong> to get a deal at all.</p>

<p>Why? One difficulty is to construct the agreements. The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devices and then <strong>hammer</strong> out different pacts covering, say, electronic goods and drug manufacturing. The EU-following fine <strong>continental</strong> traditions—wants agreement on general principles, which could be applied to many types of products and have extended to other countries.</p>

<h1 id="royal-espionage">Royal <strong>espionage</strong></h1>

<p>Alfred the Great acted as his own spy, visiting Danish camps disguised as a <strong>minstrel</strong>. In those days wandering minstrels were welcome everywhere. They were not fighting men, and their <strong>harp</strong> was their passport. Alfred had learned many of their <strong>ballads</strong> in his youth, and could vary his programme with <strong>acrobatic</strong> tricks and simple <strong>conjuring</strong>.</p>

<p>While Alfred&rsquo;s little army slowly began to gather at Athelney, the king himself set out to <strong>penetrate</strong> the camp of Guthrum, the commander of the Danish invaders. These had <strong>settled down</strong> for the winter at Chippenham: <strong>thither</strong> Alfred went. He noticed at once that discipline was slack: the Danes had the self-confidence of <strong>conquerors</strong>, and their security precautions were casual. They lived well, on the <strong>proceeds</strong> of <strong>raids</strong> on neighbouring regions. There they collected women as well as food and drink, and <strong>a life of ease</strong> had made them soft. Alfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athelney. The force there assembled was trivial compared with the Danish <strong>horde</strong>. But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer fit for prolonged battle : and that their <strong>commissariat</strong> had no organization, but depended on irregular raids.</p>

<p>So, faced with the Danish <strong>advance</strong>, Alfred did not risk open battle but <strong>harried</strong> the enemy. He was constantly on the move, drawing the Danes after him. His <strong>patrols</strong> <strong>halted</strong> the raiding parties: hunger <strong>assailed</strong> the Danish army. Now Alfred began a long series of <strong>skirmishes</strong>&ndash;and within a month the Danes had surrendered. The episode could reasonably serve as a unique <strong>epic</strong> of royal espionage!</p>
