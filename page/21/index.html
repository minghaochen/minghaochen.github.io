      <h1 id="lesson-4-seeing-hands">Lesson 4 Seeing hands</h1>

<p>In the Soviet Union several cases have been reported recently of people who can read and detect colours with their fingers, and even <strong>see through</strong> solid doors and walls. One case <strong>concerns</strong> an &lsquo;eleven-year-old schoolgirl, Vera Petrova, who has normal vision but who can also <strong>perceive</strong> things with different parts of her skin, and through solid walls. This ability was first noticed by her father. One day she came into his office and <strong>happened</strong> to put her hands on the door of a locked safe. Suddenly she asked her father why he kept so many old newspapers locked away there, and even described the way they were <strong>done up</strong> in <strong>bundles</strong>. Vera&rsquo;s curious talent was brought to the notice of a scientific research institute in the town of UIyanovsk, near where she lives, and in April she was given a series of tests by a special <strong>commission</strong> of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federal Republic. During these tests she was able to read a newspaper through an opaque screen and, stranger still, by moving her elbow over a child&rsquo;s game of Lotto she was able to describe the figures and colours printed on it; and, in another instance, wearing stockings and slippers, to <strong>make out</strong> with her foot the outlines and colours of a picture hidden under a <strong>carpet</strong>. Other experiments showed that her knees and shoulders had a similar sensitivity. During all these tests Vera was <strong>blindfold</strong>; and, indeed, except when blindfold she lacked the ability to perceive things with her skin. lt was also found that although she could perceive things with her fingers this ability ceased the moment her hands were wet.</p>

<h1 id="lesson-5-youth">Lesson 5 Youth</h1>

<p>People are always talking about &lsquo;the problem of youth&rsquo;. If there is one&ndash;which I take leave to doubt&ndash;then it is older people who create it, not the young themselves. Let us <strong>get down to</strong> fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings&ndash;people just like their elders. There is only one difference between an old man and a young one: the young man has a glorious future before him and the old one has a splendid future behind him: and maybe that is where the <strong>rub</strong> is.
When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and uncertain&ndash;that I was a new boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking.
I find young people exciting. They have an air of freedom, and they have not a <strong>dreary</strong> commitment to mean ambitions or love of comfort. They are not anxious social climbers, and they have <strong>no devotion to</strong> material things. All this seems to me to link them with life, and the origins of things. It&rsquo;s as if they were in some sense cosmic beings in <strong>violent</strong> and lovely contrast with us <strong>suburban</strong> creatures. All that is in my mind when I meet a young person. He may be <strong>conceited</strong>, ill-mannered, <strong>presumptuous</strong> or <strong>fatuous</strong>, but I do not turn for protection to <strong>dreary</strong> <strong>clichés</strong> about respect for elders&ndash;as if mere age were a reason for respect. I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong.</p>

<h1 id="lesson-6-the-sporting-spirit">Lesson 6 The sporting spirit</h1>

<p>I am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates <strong>goodwill</strong> between the nations, and that if only the common peoples of the world could meet one another at football or cricket, they would have no <strong>inclination</strong> to meet on the battlefield. Even if one didn&rsquo;t know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to <strong>orgies</strong> of hatred, one could <strong>deduce</strong> it from general principles. Nearly all the sports practised nowadays are competitive. You play to win, and the game has little meaning unless you do your utmost to win. On the village green, where you <strong>pick up sides</strong> and no feeling of local <strong>patriotism</strong> is involved, it is possible to play simply for the fun and exercise: but as soon as the question of <strong>prestige</strong> arises, as soon as you feel that you and some larger unit will be <strong>disgraced</strong> if you lose, the most <strong>savage</strong> combative instincts are <strong>aroused</strong>. Anyone who has played even in a school football match knows this. At the international level sport is frankly mimic <strong>warfare</strong>. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the <strong>spectators</strong>: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into <strong>furies</strong> over these <strong>absurd</strong> contests, and seriously believe&ndash;<strong>at any rate</strong> for short periods&ndash;that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national <strong>virtue</strong>.</p>
