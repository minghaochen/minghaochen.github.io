      <h1 id="knowledge-and-progress">Knowledge and progress</h1>

<p>Why does the idea of progress <strong>loom</strong> so large in the modern world ? Surely because progress of a particular kind is actually taking place around us and is becoming more and more <strong>manifest</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>loom / luːm / If something looms over you, it appears as a large or unclear shape, often in a frightening way. 赫然出现;</li>
<li>manifest / ˈmænɪˌfɛst / If you say that something is manifest, you mean that it is clearly true and that nobody would disagree with it if they saw it or considered it. 明显的</li>
</ul>

<p>Although mankind has undergone no general improvement in intelligence or morality, it has made extraordinary progress the accumulation of knowledge. Knowledge began to increase as soon as the thoughts of one individual could be communicated to another by means of speech.</p>

<ul>
<li>yyy began to zzz as soon as xxx; 一旦xxx yyy就zzz</li>
<li>by means of xxx</li>
</ul>

<p>With the invention of writing, a great advance was made, for knowledge could then be not only communicated but also stored.</p>

<ul>
<li>for xxx could then be not only yyy but also zzz; xxx不仅能 yyy 而且能zzz</li>
</ul>

<p>Libraries made education possible, and education in its turn added to libraries: the growth of knowledge followed a kind of compound-interest law, which was greatly enhanced by the invention of printing.</p>

<ul>
<li>in its turn 反过来</li>
<li>compound interest law 雪球增长的规律</li>
</ul>

<p>All this was comparatively slow until, with the coming science, the tempo was suddenly raised. Then knowledge began to be accumulated according to a systematic plan. The <strong>trickle</strong> became a stream; the stream has now become a <strong>torrent</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>trickle  / ˈtrɪkəl / When a liquid trickles, or when you trickle it, it flows slowly in a thin stream. 使细流; 细流</li>
<li>torrent  / ˈtɒrənt / A torrent is a lot of water falling or flowing rapidly or violently. 急流</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, as soon as new knowledge is acquired, it is now turned to practical account. What is called &lsquo;modern civilization&rsquo; is not the result of a balanced development of all man&rsquo;s nature, but of accumulated knowledge applied to practical life.</p>

<ul>
<li>a balanced development of xxx; xxx的平衡发展</li>
<li>all man&rsquo;s nature 人的天性</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem now facing humanity is: What is going to be done with all this knowledge ? As is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or evil.</p>

<ul>
<li>the problem now facing xxx is yyy; 现在xxx面临的问题是yyy</li>
</ul>

<p>It is now being used indifferently for both. Could any <strong>spectacle</strong>, for instance, be more grimly <strong>whimsical</strong> than that of gunners using science to shatter men&rsquo;s bodies while, close at hand, surgeons use it to restore them ?</p>

<ul>
<li>spectacle / ˈspɛktəkəl / A spectacle is a strange or interesting sight. 奇观</li>
<li>whimsical  / ˈwɪmzɪkəl /  A whimsical person or idea is unusual, playful, and unpredictable, rather than serious and practical. 异想天开的</li>
<li>shatter / ˈʃætə / If something shatters or is shattered, it breaks into a lot of small pieces. 粉碎</li>
</ul>

<p>We have to ask ourselves very seriously what will happen if this twofold use of knowledge, with its ever-increasing
power, continues.</p>

<ul>
<li>twofold  / ˈtuːˌfəʊld / 双重的</li>
<li>ever-increasing 日益增长</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="bird-flight">Bird flight</h1>

<p>No two sorts of birds practise quite the same sort of flight; the varieties are infinite, but two classes may be roughly seen. Any ship that crosses the pacific is accompanied for many days by the smaller <strong>albatross</strong>, which may keep company with the <strong>vessel</strong> for an hour without visible or more than occasional movement of wing.</p>

<ul>
<li>albatross  / ˈælbəˌtrɒs / An albatross is a very large white seabird. 信天翁</li>
<li>vessel  / ˈvɛsəl / A vessel is a ship or large boat. 船; 舰</li>
</ul>

<p>The currents of air that the walls of the ship direct upwards, as well as in the line of its course are enough to give the great bird with its immense wings sufficient <strong>sustenance</strong> and progress.</p>

<ul>
<li>sustenance / ˈsʌstənəns / Sustenance is food or drink which a person, animal, or plant needs to remain alive and healthy. 食物</li>
<li>progress</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>albatross</strong> is the king of the <strong>gliders</strong>, the class of fliers which <strong>harness</strong> the air to their purpose, but must yield to its opposition.</p>

<ul>
<li>glider / ˈɡlaɪdə / A glider is an aircraft without an engine, which flies by floating on air currents. 滑翔机</li>
<li>harness  / ˈhɑːnɪs / If you harness something such as an emotion or natural source of energy, you bring it under your control and use it. 利用</li>
<li>yield  / jiːld /  If you yield to someone or something, you stop resisting them. 屈服</li>
</ul>

<p>In the contrary school the duck is supreme. It comes nearer to the engines with which man has &lsquo;conquered&rsquo; the air, as he boasts. Duck, and like them the pigeons, are <strong>endowed</strong> with steel-like muscles, that are a good part of the weight of the bird, and these will <strong>ply</strong> the short wings with irresistible power that they can bore for long distances through an opposite <strong>gale</strong> before exhaustion follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>in the contrary school 相对的</li>
<li>it comes nearer to xxx；它更近乎于xxx</li>
<li>endow  / ɪnˈdaʊ / You say that someone is endowed with a particular desirable ability, characteristic, or possession when they have it by chance or by birth. 天生赋予</li>
<li>ply  / plaɪ / If you ply someone with food or drink, you keep giving them more of it. 不断供给</li>
<li>gale  / ɡeɪl / A gale is a very strong wind. 大风</li>
<li>exhaustion  / ɪɡˈzɔːstʃən / Exhaustion is the state of being so tired that you have no energy left. 精疲力竭</li>
</ul>

<p>Their <strong>humbler</strong> followers, such as partridges, have a like power of strong <strong>propulsion</strong>, but soon tire. You may pick them up in utter exhaustion, if wind over the sea has driven them to a long journey.</p>

<ul>
<li>their humbler followers，such as yyy, zzz；次于他们的xxx，yyy</li>
<li>humble  / ˈhʌmbəl /  People with low social status are sometimes described as humble. (社会地位) 低下的</li>
<li>propulsion  / prəˈpʌlʃən /  Propulsion is the power that moves something, especially a vehicle, in a forward direction. 推进力</li>
<li>utter  / ˈʌtə / You use utter to emphasize that something is great in extent, degree, or amount. 完全的; 彻底的</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>swallow</strong> shares the virtues of both schools in highest measure. It tires not, nor does it boast of its power; but belongs to the air, travelling it may be six thousand miles to and from its northern nesting home, feeding its flown young as it flies and slipping through a medium that seems to help its passage
even when the wind is adverse.</p>

<ul>
<li>swallow / ˈswɒləʊ / A swallow is a kind of small bird with pointed wings and a forked tail. 燕子</li>
<li>in highest measure 充分的</li>
<li>it xxx not, nor does it yyy； 既不xxx也不xxx</li>
<li>slip  / slɪp /</li>
<li>passage  / ˈpæsɪdʒ /  旅程，行程</li>
</ul>

<p>Such birds do us good, though we no longer take omens from their flight on this side and that, and even the most <strong>superstitious</strong> villagers no longer take off their hats to the <strong>magpie</strong> and wish it good-morning.</p>

<ul>
<li>omen  / ˈəʊmən /  If you say that something is an omen, you think it indicates what is likely to happen in the future and whether it will be good or bad. 预兆</li>
</ul>
