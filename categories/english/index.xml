      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;dead-on-arrival&#34;&gt;Dead on arrival&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A one-sided deal highlights the need for new leadership on all sides&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE &lt;strong&gt;PROSPECT&lt;/strong&gt;(前景) of peace between Israel and the Palestinians has grown so &lt;strong&gt;dim&lt;/strong&gt;(暗淡的), it is easy to forget that President Donald Trump’s efforts to end the conflict began with much promise. The dealmaker-in-chief vowed to bring fresh thinking to the decades-old &lt;strong&gt;feud&lt;/strong&gt;(不和). “As with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises,” he told Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel(以色列)’s prime minister, in 2017. Mr Trump’s meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, a few months later, ended with the Palestinian(巴勒斯坦的) president &lt;strong&gt;gushing&lt;/strong&gt;(涌出): “With you we have hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed, though, was neither bold thinking nor any demand for sacrifices on both sides. Rather, Mr Trump showered Mr Netanyahu, a fellow populist(平民党党员), with political gifts. He recognised the disputed &lt;strong&gt;holy&lt;/strong&gt; city of Jerusalem耶路撒冷(以色列首都) as Israel’s capital. His State Department declared that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are lawful. (Few legal scholars agree.) Mr Trump cut aid to the Palestinians, even for health and education, and closed their diplomatic mission in Washington. All this delighted his pro-Israel supporters back home, but enraged Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the context for Mr Trump’s unveiling of his long-awaited peace plan with Mr Netanyahu on January 28th (see article). It will not bring peace. But it may &lt;strong&gt;spell&lt;/strong&gt;(导致) the end of the two-state solution—the idea that a Palestinian state and a Jewish one might agree to co-exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a different time, under a different president, the proposal might have been the starting-point for more talks. Not an &lt;strong&gt;evenhanded&lt;/strong&gt;(公平的) starting-point, mind. The plan favours Israeli hardliners as no previous American plan has done. It lets Israel formally &lt;strong&gt;annex&lt;/strong&gt;(获得) the settlements, hang on to the Jordan valley, maintain control of holy sites and reject Palestinian refugees. For the Palestinians, there are conditional promises of something like a state at some point in the future, with a capital on the &lt;strong&gt;outskirts&lt;/strong&gt;(市郊) of Jerusalem, plus billions of dollars of investment and an Israeli promise to freeze some settlement-building. If they negotiate, they might get a better deal, suggests the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Palestinians do not believe it. If Mr Trump were serious about &lt;strong&gt;peacemaking&lt;/strong&gt;(调解), why did he try to &lt;strong&gt;woo&lt;/strong&gt;(追求) only one side? No Palestinian leader could have accepted the deal, let alone one as weak as Mr Abbas. Mr Trump did not even invite him to the unveiling, which anyway seemed designed to distract Americans from &lt;strong&gt;impeachment&lt;/strong&gt;(怀疑) (see article), and Israelis from corruption charges against Mr Netanyahu. The prime minister appears eager to end the Palestinian dream of statehood. He has already asked his cabinet to vote on annexing parts of the West Bank, and is &lt;strong&gt;whipping&lt;/strong&gt;(鞭打) up &lt;strong&gt;hawkish&lt;/strong&gt;(强硬派的) voters ahead of a tough election on March 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should Mr Netanyahu win another term, he will undoubtedly move ahead with annexation(合并). His main challenger, Benny Gantz, will face pressure to do the same if he is &lt;strong&gt;victorious&lt;/strong&gt;. Far from easing the conflict, Mr Trump has pushed it down a &lt;strong&gt;perilous&lt;/strong&gt;(危险的) path. He has given Israel a green light to take so much territory that a coherent Palestinian state is all but impossible. And he offers no viable alternative to the two-state solution. That may soon leave Israel with a choice: give the Palestinians equal rights and watch as they multiply and outvote Jews, or treat them as second-class citizens and formally become an &lt;strong&gt;apartheid&lt;/strong&gt;(种族隔离) state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best that can be said of the Trump plan is that it acknowledges the Oslo peace process is &lt;strong&gt;moribund&lt;/strong&gt;(停滞不前的) and a new approach is needed. But a successful peace deal means not only discarding what has not worked, but also coming up with what will: a plan that demands &lt;strong&gt;concessions&lt;/strong&gt;(让步) from both sides as well as fair-minded leaders to implement it. This is not that plan. And Mr Trump, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas are not those leaders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;title&#34;&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the Wuhan virus become a pandemic?
Probably. But public health services can help determine how severe it turns out to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pandemic: a disease that affects people over a very large area or the whole world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-1&#34;&gt;Paragraph 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things explain why a new infectious disease is so alarming. One is that, at first, it spreads exponentially. As tens of cases become hundreds and hundreds become thousands, the mathematics run away with you, conjuring speculation about a health-care collapse, social and economic upheaval and a deadly pandemic. The other is profound uncertainty. Sparse data and conflicting reports mean that scientists can not rule out the worst case—and that lets bad information thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conjure: to make something appear or happen in a way which is not expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speculation: when you guess about the possible causes or effects of something without knowing all the facts. 例：There is speculation that the president is ill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upheaval: a very big change that often causes problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-2&#34;&gt;Paragraph 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is with a new coronavirus, known as2019-nCoV, which has struck in China. The number of reported cases grew from 282 on January 20th to almost 7,800 just nine days later. In that time four reported cases outside mainland China have multiplied to 105 in 19 territories. Doubt clouds fundamental properties of the disease, including how it is passed on and what share of infected people die. Amid the uncertainty, a simulation of a coronavirus outbreak by Johns Hopkins University in October, in which 65m people lost their lives, was put about as a prediction. It is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strike: 类似于hit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud: 云延伸出来就是“使模糊”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-3&#34;&gt;Paragraph 3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the right questions, though: will the new virus become a global disease? And how deadly will it be? A definite answer is weeks or months away, but public-health authorities have to plan today. The best guess is that the disease has taken hold in China and there is a high risk that it spreads around the world—it may even become a recurrent seasonal infection. It may turn out to be no more lethal than seasonal influenza, but that would still count as serious. In the short term that would hit the world economy and, depending on how the outbreak is handled, it could also have political effects in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take hold: to start to have a definite effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lethal: causing death, or able to cause death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-4&#34;&gt;Paragraph 4&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outbreak began in December. The repeated mingling of people and animals in China means that viral mutations that infect humans are likely to arise there; and mass migration to cities means that they are likely to spread between people. This virus probably originated in bats and passed through mammals, such as palm civets (果子狸) or ferret badgers (鼬獾), ending up in Wuhan’s wet market, where wild animals were on sale. Symptoms resemble flu, but can include pneumonia, which may be fatal. About 20\% of reported cases are severe, and need hospital care; about 2\% of them have been fatal. As yet, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mingling: if two feelings, sounds, smells etc mingle, they mix together with each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wet market: 指的是传统市场，卖生鲜的这种&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pneumonia: 肺炎&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccine: 疫苗&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antiviral: 复合词的结构，抗病毒&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-5&#34;&gt;Paragraph 5&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest uncertainty is how many cases have gone unrecorded. Primary health care is rudimentary in China and some of the ill either avoided or were turned away from busy hospitals. Many more may have such mild symptoms that they do not realise they have the disease. Modelling by academics in Hong Kong suggests that, as of January 25th, tens of thousands of people have already been infected and that the epidemic will peak in a few months’ time. If so, the virus is more widespread than thought, and hence will be harder to contain within China. But it will also prove less lethal, because the number of deaths should be measured against a much larger base of infections. As with flu, a lot of people could die nonetheless. In 2017-18 a bad flu season saw symptoms in 45m Americans, and 61,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rudimentary: simple and basic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-6&#34;&gt;Paragraph 6&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have started work on vaccines and on treatments to make infections less severe. These are six to 12 months away, so the world must fall back on public-health measures. In China that has led to the biggest quarantine in history, as Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province have been sealed off. The impact of such draconian measures has rippled throughout China. The spring holiday has been extended, keeping schools and businesses closed. The economy is running on the home-delivery of food and goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarantine: a period of time when a person or animal is kept apart from others in case they are carrying a disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draconian: very strict and cruel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ripple: to pass from one person to another like a wave. 例：Panic rippled through Hollywood as the murders were discovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-7&#34;&gt;Paragraph 7&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many experts praise China’s efforts. Certainly, its scientists have coped better with the Wuhan virus than they did with SARS in 2003, rapidly detecting it, sequencing its genome (基因测序), licensing diagnostic kits (诊断试剂) and informing international bodies. China’s politicians come off less well. They left alone the cramped markets filled with wild animals that spawned SARS. With the new virus, local officials in Wuhan first played down the science and then, when the disease had taken hold, enacted the draconian quarantine fully eight hours after announcing it, allowing perhaps 1m potentially infectious people to leave the city first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cramped: not have enough space. 例：The kitchen was small and cramped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spawn: to make a series of things happen or start to exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enact: to make a proposal into a law. 例：Congress refused to enact the bill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-8&#34;&gt;Paragraph 8&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may have undermined a measure which is taking a substantial toll. China’s growth in the first quarter could fall to as little as 2\%, from 6\% before the outbreak. As China accounts for almost a fifth of world output, there will probably be a noticeable dent on global growth. Though the economy will bounce back when the virus fades, the reputation of the Communist Party and even of Xi Jinping may be more lastingly affected. The party claims that, armed with science, it is more efficient at governing than democracies. The heavy-handed failure to contain the virus suggests otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substantial: large in amount or number; considerable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dent: a reduction in the amount of something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contain: to stop something from spreading or escaping. 例：Doctors are struggling to contain the epidemic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-9&#34;&gt;Paragraph 9&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside China such quarantines are unthinkable. The medical and economic cost will depend on governments slowing the disease’s spread. The way to do this is by isolating cases as soon as they crop up and tracing and quarantining people that victims have been in contact with—indeed, if the disease burns out in China, that might yet stop the pandemic altogether. If, by contrast, that proves inadequate, they could shut schools, discourage travel and urge the cancellation of public events. Buying time in this way has advantages even if it does not completely stop the disease. Health-care systems would have a greater chance to prepare for the onslaught, and to empty beds that are now full of people with seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crop up: if a problem crops up, it happens or appears suddenly and in an unexpected way; arise. 例：if anything crops up, give me a call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-10&#34;&gt;Paragraph 10&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all those efforts the epidemic could still be severe. Some health systems, in Africa and the slums of Asia’s vast cities, will not be able to isolate patients and trace contacts. Much depends on whether people are infectious when their symptoms are mild (or before they show any at all, as some reports suggest), because such people are hard to spot. And also on whether the virus mutates to become more transmissible or lethal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slum: an area that is in bad condition, where very poor people live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spot: to notice someone or something, especially when they are difficult to see or recognize. 例：I spotted a police car behind us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutate: a change in genetic structure. 例：Simple organisms like bacteria mutate rapidly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;paragraph-11&#34;&gt;Paragraph 11&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world has never responded as rapidly to a disease as it has to 2019-nCoV. Even so, the virus may still do great harm. As humans encroach on new habitats, farm more animals, gather in cities, travel and warm the planet, new diseases will become more common. One estimate puts their cost at $60bn a year. SARS, MERS, Nipah, Zika, Mexican swine flu: the fever from Wuhan is the latest of a bad bunch. It will not be the last.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;不知道你会不会傻傻分不清楚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;likes  /s/ 还是 /z/？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lives /s/ 还是 /z/？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首先说说 /s/ 和 /z/ 的发音，需要注意的是这个 /z/ 的发音其实和 /s/ 是一样的！只是在 /s/ 的基础上加上了声带的震动， &lt;strong&gt;不是中文拼音里的 z，是中文拼音里的 z，是中文拼音里的 z&lt;/strong&gt;！！！ 重要的事情说三遍，很多小伙伴很可能都是按照拼音的 ‘zi’ 来发音(包括我之前也是)那就要好好改改咯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;知道了怎么发音我们再来看几个单词，你试着读读看？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set 1: likes/books/laughs/mats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set 2: lives/feels/cares&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set 3: is/has/was/these/because&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;答案揭晓：&lt;strong&gt;第一组都发 /s/，第二组都发 /z/，第三组都发 /z/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不知道你发对了没有还是 /s/ 和 /z/ 胡乱发一通，搞不清楚也没关系，我们先来找找规律，第一组 s 前都是什么？对！是以&lt;strong&gt;清辅音&lt;/strong&gt; 结尾的；第二组呢？是以&lt;strong&gt;浊辅音&lt;/strong&gt;结尾的，第三组则是&lt;strong&gt;元音&lt;/strong&gt;结尾的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;那你就记住：&lt;strong&gt;/s/ 是清辅音，那就接在清辅音后面，/z/ 是浊辅音那就接在浊辅音后面，元音后面通常跟 /z/&lt;/strong&gt;，OK，再试试把上面三组单词读一遍感受一下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;问题又来了，有的小伙伴会问什么是清辅音，什么是浊辅音，这个很好判断，你摸着你的声带，发音时感受到声带的就是浊辅音，比如/b/,/d/,/g/,/v/,/z/，不震动的就是清辅音，比如/p/,/t/,/k/,/f/,/s/。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;还有一个关于浊辅音和清辅音的技巧就是：&lt;strong&gt;浊辅音前的元音发音更“长”一点&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不信你对比一下以下几组单词： back 和 bag; safe 和save; pick 和 pig; lock 和 log; cup 和 cub&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;是不是发音每组单词中后面那个单词的元音都拉得比较长呢，那就对了！&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>美音中t的发音</title>
      <link>https://minghaochen.github.io/post/%E7%BE%8E%E9%9F%B3%E4%B8%ADt%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%91%E9%9F%B3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;今天做高铁回家路上刚好看了Jason的视频，总结一下美音中 t 的发音技巧，同时感谢一下Jason哥。
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://minghaochen.github.io/images/post/%e7%be%8e%e9%9f%b3%e4%b8%adt%e7%9a%84%e5%8f%91%e9%9f%b3/%e7%be%8e%e9%9f%b3%e4%b8%adt%e7%9a%84%e5%90%84%e7%a7%8d%e5%8f%91%e9%9f%b3.svg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这里的说法可能跟网上的一些说法不太一致，这里的 held t就是网上说的 stop t，简单理解就是 t 做出口形舌形但不发音，但是需要停顿一下而不是直接省略，达到所谓的 held 住或者 stop 的效果；这里的发音成 fast d 就是网上说的 flap t，弹舌音，简单理解就是舌头快速弹一下发出 d 的音，也就是发音现象中的浊化。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;连读主要有三种情况：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;辅元连读&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;辅辅连读&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. 发音相同，只发后一个音&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. 发音点相同，(t和d，b和p等)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;元元连读&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. 第一个元音以 i (包括/oi/,/ai/,/ei/)结尾，后面加上 y 的音：see (y) it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b.  第一个元音以u (包括/ou/)结尾，后面加上 w 的音：who (w) is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>
