.. _configure-MMLorHTML:

************************************************
The MMLorHTML configuration options (Deprecated)
************************************************

.. warning::

  This extension has been deprecated in MathJax v2.6.  See
  :ref:`automatic selection of output processors <automatic-output-switch>` for alternatives.

The options below control the operation of the MMLorHTML configuration
file that is run when you include ``"MMLorHTML.js"`` in the `config`
array of your configuration, or when you use one of the combined
configuration files that ends with ``_HTMLorMML``.  They are listed
with their default values.  To set any of these options, include a
``MMLorHTML`` section in your :meth:`MathJax.Hub.Config()` call.  For
example

.. code-block:: javascript

    MathJax.Hub.Config({
      MMLorHTML: {
        prefer: {
	  Opera: "MML"
	}
      }
    });

would set the ``prefer`` option so that the Opera browser would prefer
MathML to HTML-CSS output (while leaving the settings for other
browsers unchanged).

Note that if you use the ``MMLorHTML.js`` configuration file, you should
**not** specify an output processor in the `jax` array of your
configuration; `MMLorHTML` will fill that in for you.

.. describe:: prefer: {
                MSIE: "MML",
	        Firefox: "HTML",
	        Safari: "HTML",
	        Chrome: "HTML",
	        Opera: "HTML",
	        other: "HTML"
	      }

   This lets you set the preferred renderer on a browser-by-browser
   basis.  You set the browser to either ``"MML"`` or ``"HTML"``
   depending on whether you want to use the `NativeMML` or `HTML-CSS`
   output processor.  Note that although Opera and Safari do process some MathML
   natively, their support is not sufficient to handle the more
   complicated output generated by MathJax, so their settings are
   ``"HTML"`` by default.  Although Firefox does support a large
   subset of MathJax, it does not implement all the features needed by
   MathJax, and so it is also set to ``"HTML"`` by default (this is
   new in v2.0).

   Note that users can still use the MathJax contextual menu to select
   a different renderer after the default one has been chosen by
   ``MMLorHTML.js``.

MathJax produces MathML that models the underlying mathematics as best
it can, rather than using complicated hacks to improve output for a
particular MathML implementation.  When you make the choice to use the
NativeMML output processor, you are making a trade-off: gaining speed
at the expense of quality and reliability, a decision that should not
be taken lightly.
